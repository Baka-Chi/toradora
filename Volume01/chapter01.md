"Damn it!"

Seven-thirty in the morning on a fine day, and yet it was dim inside the apartment. The apartment consisted of two rooms plus a kitchen, faced south in a two-story townhouse, and was about a ten minute walk from the railway station. Rent was around 80,000 yen a month.

"I give up! I just can't get this right!"

A hand frustratedly wiped the condensation from the mirror. The run-down bathroom was foggy from an early morning shower. So after wiping the mirror, it immediately clouded up again. It was pointless to take anger out on the mirror no matter how frustrated one was...

"This is a rip-off!"

*Give yourself a gentle appearance with floating bangs* was the claim in the latest men's fashion magazine. Ryūji Takasu's bangs were now "floating":
as the article instructed, he had pulled his bangs out at length, blow-dried them until they stood up, and then gently rubbed them sideways with some hair gel.

He even woke up half an hour earlier than usual in order to do his hair like the model's. "Trying to change my face just by doing my bangs was foolish of me," he thought.

Ryūji dejectedly threw the trendy magazine, which had taken him quite a bit of courage to buy, into the garbage bin. Unfortunately, his aim was off and the magazine missed the garbage, landing open on the ground beside it, but not before knocking all the trash out of the bin.

The magazine fell open to a page which read "Gentle or wild? You can still begin your journey towards modeling in time for the start of school!"

"I don't care about modeling at all. I just wanted to change my appearance. But I failed even at that."

Feeling defeated, Ryūji wet his hands with water and mussed up his hair which he had just spent so much time attempting to reinvent, reverting it to its usual plain, straight self. He then knelt down to pick up the trash that was now strewn all over the ground.

"Wha-? What's this...m-mold? It's moldy?!"

Even though he always wiped the moisture off, even after spending a whole day last week cleaning out the mold in the kitchen and bathroom, all his effort had gone to waste in this horribly humid bathroom.

Biting his lips begrudgingly, Ryūji tried wiping off the mold with some paper tissues.

Of course, it wasn't quite that easy, and he ended up tearing the tissues to shreds.

"Damn, I used it all up a while ago. I'm going to have to buy some mold remover again." *For now I'll have to leave you alone, but I'll definitely come back and destroy you!* Ryūji glanced down at the moldy patch while he picked up the trash. He then gave the ground a rough wipe with some paper towels, clearing up any loose hair and dust and wiping off the condensation on the sink before lifting his head up and sighing.

"Oh yeah, pet food. Hey, Inko-chan!"

"Ah...?" A high-pitched avian voice responded to the high-school student's greeting.

"Good, you're awake."  Getting himself together again, Ryūji went barefoot into the wooden-floored kitchen, took some prepared pet food and spare newspapers, and headed towards the corner of the tatami-covered living room.
Removing the cloth over the birdcage there, Ryūji greeted his parakeet.

Now, other people may kept their pets differently, but this was how the Takasus kept their pet parakeet. Because Inko-chan looked rather disheveled when he slept, they covered him with a cloth at night.

"Good morning, Inko-chan."

A yellow parakeet, that was Inko-chan. As usual, Ryūji added parakeet food to the Inko-chan's bowl while talking to him.

"Go-good...morning," Inko-chan managed to reply in Japanese as his eyes blinked upwards in a rather unpleasant and enigmatic way. Though he had just woken up, it looked like he was in quite a good mood. It was actually rather adorable.

"Inko-chan, try saying *let's eat*."

"Le-let's, e...let's eat! Let's eat! Let's! Eat!"

"Okay, enough. Now let's see if you can say it! Try and see if you can say your name...come on, say *Inko-chan*."

"I-I-In-I-In-Iiii...I..." Inko-chan seemed to be using a lot of energy, as he shook his head and rapidly puffed up his body, and then flapped his wings quickly. "......iiiii......"

His eyes squinting, one could vaguely see the gray tongue that stuck out of his beak. *Maybe he can do it today*, thought Ryūji as he gripped his fists. In the end...

"Blegh!"

"Argh...Why are birds so dumb? As expected when you have a brain that only weighs a gram," Ryūji sighed, wrapping up the soiled newspaper. He threw the newspaper into a plastic bag. As he was about to put the bag together with the other trash in the kitchen, he heard: "Where...are...you...going..."

The childish woman lying behind the fusuma seemed to have woken up as well.

"Ryū-chan, is that your uniform you're wearing? Why?" she asked wearily.

Ryūji wrapped up the trash bag in an elegant knot and replied, "I'm going to school. Didn't I already tell you yesterday that school starts today?"

"Ah..." Stretching her legs on the futon, she muttered as though she were about to cry, "Then, then...Then, what about Ya-chan's...lunch? I don't smell any food...didn't you make some for me?"

"Nope."

"Ehhh...? Then...what's Ya-chan gonna do...when she wakes up...? There's nothing good to eat..."

"I'll be home by the time you wake up! I'm just going to the Term Opening Ceremony."

"Wha...is that it...hee hee hee hee," she smiled as she stopped stretching her legs and began to clap her hands...no, actually, clap her feet.

"Opening Ceremony, huh? 'Grats! That means Ryū-chan is gonna be a second year from today on?"

"Forget about that for a minute. Didn't I already tell you before, no matter how busy you are, you always have to remove your makeup before you sleep? Since you complained how bothersome it was, I specifically bought some special makeup remover tissues for you, didn't I?"

Ryūji looked closer. "Ah...AH! You've gotten makeup powder all over the pillow! I can't wash that off! You should take better care of your skin; you aren't young anymore!"

"Sorry."

Her leopard-spotted panties were completely exposed. As she got up, her large breasts shook while some of her messy blond hair got stuck in her cleavage.
Perhaps it was the way she tossed her hair, or the long nails on her fingers, but whatever it was she exuded femininity.

But at the same time..."Must've drunk too much, I just came back an hour ago.  Ah! So sleepy," she yawned. "Oh yeah...I brought some pudding home."

As she exhaled and rubbed her thick eyelashes, she slowly shambled towards the convenience store shopping bag at the corner of the room.

Her cherry lips muttering "pudding", her plump cheeks, and her round eyes — her rather child-like features seemed somewhat incongruous. Despite this, it was plain to see that she was a pretty lady.

"Huh...Ryū-chan, I can't find the spoon."

"Maybe the store assistant forgot to put it in?"

"Can't be! I saw him put it inside. That's strange..."

This was Ryūji Takasu's mother Yasuko Takasu, stage name "Mirano." Thirty-three years old (though she claimed to be forever 23), she worked as a hostess in the town's only bar, "Bishamonten Kuni."

Yasuko poured the contents of the convenience store bag out and rummaged through them at the corner of her futon. Her little face frowned,
"It's so dark in here...I can't find the spoon like this! Ryū-chan, can you open the curtains?"

"They are open."

"Eh...? Ahh, that's right...since I'm never awake so early, I must've forgotten..." Inside their dark apartment, the strange single-mother-and-son family sighed as one.

Their darkened window faced south. It had been six years since they moved in here. Inside the little apartment where the two of them lived, their only source of natural light came from the south-facing window.

As the entrance was on the north and because they were abutted on the east and west sides by their neighbors' houses, only the south side had windows.
Sunlight had been abundant, especially in the mornings. There used to be no need to turn on the lights from sunrise to sunset, unless it was raining.

The bright sunlight always used to shine abundantly on Ryūji while preparing breakfast in his uniform for the two of them, and on Yasuko who would be sleeping soundly.

However, all that came to an end last year.

"Damn that high-rise apartment building."

"I wonder what kind of people live there anyway? And turn on the lights already!" said Yasuko.

Last year, just a few meters from the south side of this house, a ten-story luxury apartment building had sprung up. As a result, the sun no longer shone in through their windows.

This had driven Ryūji to the brink of madness and frustration countless times already — the laundry no longer dried properly; the tatami mats expanded due to the humidity, curled at the corners and grew moldy; and sometimes it would even get frosty.

The wallpaper was starting to peel, which almost certainly had something to do with the humidity as well.

*It doesn't matter, since we just rent this apartment*, Ryūji wanted to tell himself. Yet, as he was adamant about keeping the place tidy and clean, Ryūji just could not get himself to tolerate nor compromise on such a thing.

Looking up towards the white-tiled high-class condo, there was nothing those two poor people could do but stand shoulder to shoulder with their mouths open.

"Hmm, it doesn't affect me much, since Ya-chan sleeps in the morning anyway!"

"Mm, I guess there's no use complaining...Besides, the rent's gone down by ¥5,000 as a result." Taking out a spoon from the kitchen and handing it to Yasuko, Ryūji scratched his head and said, "Anyway, I'm heading out now." This wasn't the time for family bonding; it was about time to leave.

Donning his school's gakuran jacket, Ryūji bent his (still growing!) body and pulled up his socks.

As he made sure he had everything, he suddenly realized a vague feeling in his gut.

That was right, today was the beginning of a new school term. After the Opening Ceremony came the changing of class.

Though he had failed in attempting to change his image, it wasn't enough to make him depressed, as *some* hope still remained in Ryūji's heart. Or was that just false expectations?

Anyway, it was some sort of faint feeling like that, something he did not find it necessary to voice out loud.

"I'm going now. Remember to lock the door, and change into your pajamas!"

"Okay! Ah, hey Ryū-chan," Yasuko laid on the futon and bit down on the spoon with her back teeth. She smiled like a little girl.

"Ryū-chan, you're looking energetic today! Fight hard! You're a second year now! This is an area which Ya-chan has never been to before, you know."

In order to give birth to Ryūji, Yasuko had dropped out of high school when she was still a first year, so she was not familiar with what life as a second year was like. Ryūji felt a sense of sadness for a moment.

"...Yeah." He smiled for a bit and raised his hand.

This was in attempt give his thanks to his mother. However, this well-intentioned act led to an unexpectedly bad result. "KYAA!" Yasuko yelled and began rolling to and fro, and finally said the dreaded phrase. She finally said that dreaded phrase!

"Ryū-chan is sooo cool! You look more and more like your dad every day!"

...She said it.

Ryūji silently closed the front door and looked towards the sky. He spun his eyes as he felt he was being sucked into a whirlpool beneath him.

*NO! I don't want that! I don't want that! Just shut up! That! That's the one thing I don't want to hear. Especially today.*

*You look just like your dad* — it seemed as though Yasuko didn't understand that this phrase caused Ryūji a lot of torment.

It was also the reason he had bought that fashion magazine and tried to make his bangs "float gently."

Having left the house, Ryūji walked towards the school, his long legs making great strides, as though he were riding the wind.

His face was twisted into a tight expression.

Sighing, he placed his fingers over his bangs in order to cover his eyes.

This was a habit of Ryūji's. Indeed, the source of Ryūji's agony was none other than his eyes.

They were bad! It had nothing to do with his perfect eyesight. It was their appearance; they simply looked fierce.

This past year Ryūji had been growing at a rapid pace. He really looked grown-up, too. Though he wasn't the super-handsome type, he was not exactly the aloof geek either...Well, anyway, he didn't look bad, though no one else had said that; that was simply what Ryūji thought.

However, his eyes were unusually fierce.

His eyes were the sort that tilted upwards with the whites occupying most of his eyes while his pupils only occupied a small part of them.

Of course, that was just for staters; that was not even the worst part:
Since his eyes were big, the white in his eyes would constantly reflect a very strong, stinging glare, while his tiny pupils would move sharply as though they were about to slice the opponent before him, regardless of Ryūji's intentions.

It was these eyes that usually led to a person running away at full speed upon coming into eye contact with him.

He knew it all too well. In fact, when he saw a group photo with himself, even he would wonder, "Yikes, why does he look so pissed?...Wait, is that me?"

On the other hand, it could be partly blamed on his rough personality.
He spoke in a rather unrefined way, which had something to do with his extreme sensitivity. He rarely joked around or said anything silly.

Maybe it was because of that, or maybe it was because he lived with someone like Yasuko, which caused him to lose his trust and patience.

Above all else, Ryūji prided himself in being pragmatic and independent. But, as a result...

"Ta–Takasu-kun...! Are you trying to defy a teacher!? S-someone! Bring me a baton!"

*No I wasn't! I was just trying to apologize for forgetting to hand in my homework.*

"I-I-I-I-I'm so sorry...I didn't mean to bump into you! It was that guy who pushed me over to you!"

*Who's going to get mad over getting bumped on the shoulder?*

"I heard Takasu-kun crashed a graduation ceremony of some other school while he was in junior high. He even took over their broadcast room!"

*Stop making me sound like I'm some sort of delinquent!*

"Am I going to get all these misunderstandings all over again?" Thinking back on all these painful memories, Ryūji couldn't help but sigh.

His grades were not bad, and he had never been late or absent.
He hadn't even gotten into an argument with people, let alone into a fistfight.

To put it simply, Takasu Ryūji was just a normal young guy. Despite that, due to his fierce eyes, and exclusively this, everyone had come to the conclusion that he was some kind of vicious delinquent. His only relative being a night hostess didn't help matters one bit.

After spending a year with his classmates though, most of the misunderstandings had been resolved. A year wasn't a short time, especially for a high school student. The problem was that everything was starting over again today, not to mention his failed effort at changing his image.

There *was* still something to look forward to in changing classes, since Ryūji wanted to be in the same class as a certain person...But when his thoughts moved to the torment that he would have to face, what little naive hope he had had instantly shrank by half.

Not to mention Yasuko's big mouth...No, that was not quite it. All the blame had to be on his father's troublesome genes!

"Your dad, huh? He's in heaven now. He was so cool, how he used to calmly sweep his hair backwards, and how his sharp shoes were always shiny, and how he always hung such a long gold chain around his neck while wearing a casual suit with his Rolex. Inside, he always stuffed a thick magazine.

"What for? When Ya-chan asked him that, he said 'So that I don't have to worry about getting stabbed.' Ahhh, I was so moved!"

All Ryūji could think of was how Yasuko swooned when talking about him, and then there was the only photo of his father that was left behind. His father in the photo was just as Yasuko had described him: standing open-footed while looking proud, he carried a small briefcase under his armpit. He was dressed in a white suit with a flamboyant open neck shirt. The two golden rings on his fingers glittered and he even wore a diamond earring in one ear.

And then there was his face that read "You talkin' to me?", with his chin pointing downwards towards the camera. One of his hands was groping his mother's breast, who looked much younger than she was now. His mother, carrying a pregnant belly, smiled cheerfully. His father even had a gold tooth as he smiled.

"He was actually quite gentle, and serious, and would never hurt a normal person," or at least that was what Yasuko would say, but why on Earth would a gentle and serious person become a gangster?

And who on earth would let such a young high school girl get pregnant?

And more importantly, those eyes...When those sharp eyes stared at people, they would quickly hand over their wallets and hope nothing else bad happened.

Those eyes had been used for just that: violent extortion. And now those eyes were a part of Ryūji's face.

Ryūji suddenly shuddered. If even he thought of his father that way, no wonder everyone else had that impression of Ryūji!

Actually, it was possible that his father was still alive. According to Yasuko, while helping a gang underling escape, he was beaten to a pulp and dropped to the bottom of Yokohama Harbor.

However, there was no grave, no altar, no artifacts, no epitaph, not even a body; there was no record of such an event ever happening.

Sometimes a drunk Yasuko would suddenly say unprovoked, "I wonder what Ryū-chan would look like if your dad were to suddenly return? Hohohoho, I'm just kidding!"

*Dad is probably resting in some icy cold grave! As his son, I just feel that—*

"Hey, Takasu! Morning! It's a great morning, isn't it?"

Hearing someone call him from behind, Ryūji quickly turned around and raised his hand, "Oh, Kitamura. Morning!"

*Damn, even when I stop and wait for a friend to catch up, people can't help but think that I'm waiting to strangle him to death, even though that's not the case at all!*

Ryūji silently considered this. Being misunderstood was unavoidable, and in such an event he would just have to explain as nicely as he could. As long as he was patient about it, people would eventually understand. Still, it was quite a bother. But that was the only thing he could do, so it was the only thing he had to do!

Looking up at the blue sky, the bright sunlight caused Ryūji to squint his eyes. It *was* a fine day; there wasn't even any wind. The cherry blossoms which were now quietly wilting by this time of year fell gently on Ryūji's head.

Ryūji continued to brood as he strode forward in his shiny black shoes. It sure was nice weather for today's Opening Ceremony, at least.


\*\*\*


"Whoa! We're in the same class as Takasu, you gotta be kidding me!"

"He sure looks intimidating, how scary!"

"So who's going to go talk to him?"

"Nope, not me."

"Why don't you go? Hey! Don't push...!"

*Say whatever you want, I am no longer affected by anything.*

Ryūji entered the classroom in his best possible unfazed manner, ignoring the glances of his classmates, and sat on his desk with his back towards them while staring into the distance with his sharp eyes.

Licking his dry lips, his legs began to shake on their own. To a bystander, he looked like a vicious carnivore on the lookout for weak prey.

"Same as usual, huh? Looks like there will be people that misunderstand you here as well. Oh well, it will all get sorted out after a while anyway! Besides, I'm with you, not to mention there's quite a few of our classmates from Class A here."

"Oh, don't worry about that, I don't really mind," Ryūji replied with a gentle smile to his good friend Yūsaku Kitamura, who was in his class again this year.

Honestly, Ryūji was currently in a very good mood, but not in a way where he would cruelly lick his lips just before pouncing on his prey.

If that were the case, he wouldn't be grinning from ear to ear and ready to lift off like a rocket.

The reason he was happy was not because of his relation with Kitamura.
To a friend like him, Ryūji would simply smile gently and say, "Looks like we're in the same class again, Kitamura!"

No, the reason he felt like blasting off was because of-

"Oh! Kitamura-kun! We're in the same class this year!"

—her.

"Huh? Ah! Kushieda, you're also in Class C?" said Kitamura.

<!--[[Image:Toradora vol01 029.jpg|thumb]]-->

"Eh!? You mean you only just found out? How sad! At least check the class roster on the first day of school!"

"My bad. What a coincidence! This means we can have more time to sort out our club meetings!"

"Ahaha, that's right! Oh, Takasu-kun ...right? Do you still remember me? I appear in front of Kitamura-kun from time to time." She paused. "Ah, um, is it okay if I call you Takasu-kun?"

"...Ah...er..."

An angel had revealed herself at that very moment.

Before Ryūji's eyes was a smile that shined as brightly as the sun, as warm as the sunlight that used to fall on the south window of his house, illuminating everything in his sight.

The light rays were intensifying to the point where Ryūji could no longer keep his eyes open.

"Minori Kushieda, right?" *AHH! Dammit! I got the words right! But...* His voice had sounded so forced! Ryūji felt like crying out. *Why did I only come up with a response like that? Why couldn't I come up with something better!?*

"Wow! You remembered my full name. I'm so glad!" She paused a bit, then, "Oh dear! Someone's calling me from over there! I have to go, Kitamura-kun. See you our first club meeting as second years! So don't forget! Takasu-kun, let's talk again some time!"

Seeing her turn around, Ryūji slowly and awkwardly raised his arm, but it was too late. She had already disappeared.

*She said she was glad. She said we'll talk again some time.*

Minori Kushieda.

*She said she was glad. She said we'll talk again some time.*

He finally got his wish of being in the same class as Minori Kushieda.

*She said she was glad. She said we'll talk again some time.*

*She said she was glad...*

"Takasu?"

"Whoa!" Kitamura had suddenly appeared in front of his face, causing him to fall over his chair.

"What're you grinning at?"

"No, it–it's nothing."

"Oh really?" Kitamura pushed up on the frame of his glasses with his middle finger.

Ryūji was grateful from the bottom of his heart, for Kitamura might have been the only person in this world who could tell whether he was smiling or not.

Also, there was one more thing he was grateful to Kitamura for...

"Kitamura, you," Ryūji stammered. "How should I say this. Er–you always seem pretty relaxed when you talk to girls," Ryūji went down to a whisper, "like Kushieda-san!"

"Huh? What do you mean?"

The eyes behind Kitamura's glasses widened. He wasn't being humble. Rather, he was surprised.

*Looks like he doesn't realize it himself.*

Ryūji decided to hold in what he was about to say once he realized how dense his friend was being.

Kitamura's leisurely conversation with Kushieda a while ago just sounded so *natural*.

No, it wasn't just a while ago. Since last year, Kitamura had always been able to speak with her naturally.

Furthermore, they were both in the softball club. Ryūji would always be there, constantly trying to give her a gentle smile or to receive a greeting from her. It was the kind of hopeless effort that could move one to tears.

If he'd been a soccer player, Ryūji would be like a center defender who never had any chance of participating in attacking.

It was also thanks to constantly being beside Kitamura and observing his cheerful conversations with Kushieda that Ryūji had started to realize that how cute she was and that he liked her and wanted to become friends with her.

Her various cheerful expressions.

Her delicate body and exaggerated movements.

Her innocent smiles and clear voice.

And how, despite his intimidating appearance, she still managed to keep her usual cheerfulness in his presence, even to this day.

*That's Minori Kushieda for you.*

For Ryūji, what he liked in a girl was if she could be attractive and sparkling like the rays of the sun. Being energetic and direct was more important than anything else for him, and that was how a girl should be.

But still—

"What're you talking about? How's it possible for me to talk naturally to girls? You should know very well what they like to call me!"

Ryūji couldn't help but sigh.

*How fortunate for him!*

Just looking at the way Kitamura talked was enough to make his eyes bleed.
Yet Kitamura continued, "I'm no good with girls. I think I probably won't ever find a girlfriend for the rest of my life..."

Even though he wanted to answer with "I don't think so...", looking up at his blindingly innocent yet noble friend before him, Ryūji swallowed what he was about to say.

No matter what he said, this guy would probably never understand. Ryūji suddenly felt a wave of despondency come over him.

It was true that the girls called Kitamura "Maruo", after the typical "Mr. Nice Guy" from Chibi Maruko-chan. Perhaps there was some physical resemblance, explaining how he got the nickname. But beyond that, there were a lot of other similarities: glasses with very high prescription, a straightforward personality, excellent grades, not being flirtatious, and holding quite traditional values.

He also preferred to say rather formal things like "that's correct," and he was the sort of guy who always gave off a cheerful atmosphere in the classroom.

Speaking of which, he was the former class representative, the current vice president of the Student Council, and the front-runner to be the new president of the softball team. It was natural for people to make fun of him.

His looks weren't the problem. No. To be precise, upon closer inspection one would discover that he was surprisingly handsome.

Combined with his consistent personality inside and outside, as well as his ability to make fun of himself, there was absolutely nothing unlikeable about him.

So although he claimed to be constantly teased by girls, it wasn't because they hated him.

*Ah, so that's why*, Ryūji finally understood.

Come to think of it, Kitamura was quite popular with the girls, not just with Kushieda; he was able to talk to all of them naturally.

Whenever the girls saw him, they would go, "Ah! I'm in the same class as Maruo again!" to which Kitamura would nonchalantly reply, "Oh? Is there a problem with that?"

*And yet he claims that he's no good with girls. It's not as though they fear him like me.*

Just as Ryūji was descending deep into his thoughts, he heard someone say "Whoa, scary."

*See, here we go again!*

Ryūji laid his head on top of his desk and ignored those voices that he would occasionally hear. Just a while ago he was over the moon from being in the same class as Minori Kushieda, so he did not mind the others and what they thought of him.

"Sure looks scary. I told you this guy isn't a normal person."

"Whoa, look at those eyes. If you piss the owner of those eyes off, you could get killed!"

The spell was broken. Ryūji started increasingly to notice the whispers.

*It might be better to hide in the bathroom until the new homeroom teacher arrives*, Ryūji thought. At least it would clear his mind a bit.

So he stood up, and just as he was about to walk through the door, he felt something bump into his stomach.

"Hmm...?"

Ryūji thought he had bumped into something, but there was nothing in front of his eyes.

*That's strange.* Ryūji scanned around, yet all he could see was—

Students started calling out, "Yikes! As expected from Takasu-kun! Is he going to make the first move?"

"Has the death-match started already? When I saw the class roster, I knew this was going to be a terrible class."

All Ryūji could see were the new classmates whispering amongst themselves.
*Are they talking about me? But still, why?*

"Is this the Clash of the Titans?"

"We're already in the final showdown!"

Clash of the Titans? Final showdown? What the hell are they talking about?

Ryūji tilted his head trying to make sense of what was going on.

"Are you not even going to apologize after bumping into someone?" He heard a very cold voice emanating from somewhere.

The strangely calm voice sounded suppressed, as though it were restraining volatile emotions from exploding. Yet he could not tell where the voice came from.

"Huh?"

The mood became dark.

Ryūji glanced to the right, there was no one; he glanced to the left, there was no one there as well; apprehensively, he looked upwards.

Fortunately, there was no one there either.

"That means-"

So it did come from below.

Down, right below his eyes, in a place much lower than Ryūji's chest, was a head of hair.

The first thing he thought was that she resembled a doll. She was tiny, for starters.

Long straight hair softly fluttered and covered the tiny body of the Palmtop Tiger.

"Palmtop Tiger?" A nickname suddenly appeared in Ryūji's thoughts, and without thinking he had even said it aloud. He must have heard someone whispering it nearby.

*Palmtop Tiger?*

Then that means...

"Who–"

*Is that what this little doll is called? I get the "Palmtop" part, because she's so small, but how about the "Tiger" part?*

"-who you calling a Palmtop Tiger?"

This was not an occasion where one could think for a long time, as whoever this Palmtop Tiger was began to lift her chin, and with her eyes...

"Whoa-"

It happened in a matter of three seconds.

Everything went silent, though perhaps it was only Ryūji's imagination. For an instant, it felt like a vacuum created by a shock wave just after an explosion. Then the background noise slowly returned.

By the time he realized it, Ryūji found that he had fallen backwards onto the ground.

It wasn't just him. A few classmates nearby had been hit by it as well and moaned, while others were already getting ready to escape.

Just what happened?

*I already know...nothing really happened.*

It was just that this *girl* before his eyes-

"Such a hopeless person."

All she had done was stare at Ryūji with those two large eyes of hers, nothing more.

That was it.

Within a few seconds, Ryūji had already been struck down by awe.

His mind went blank, his body felt paralyzed just by the sheer pressure she created.

Ryūji was repelled by her glare, or to be more precise, he was repelled by the aura that emanated from her eyes, causing him to fall on the ground.

It was incomparable. They were on completely different levels. For a person whose eyes were no less intimidating, Ryūji had been completely defeated.

<!--[[Image:Toradora vol01 039.jpg|thumb]]-->

This was the first time Ryūji understood what it meant to have fierce eyes. It meant having both the look as well as the ferociousness to match; or to be more exact, an "intent to kill."

"Hmph."

For a few seconds that felt like an eternity, Ryūji felt a subtle contempt in her eyes that would not be swayed even if she were stabbed in the heart.

"A dragon...? How lame."

She opened her cherry lips and shot out words like bullets that carried a certain child-like quality to them.

Her incredibly small hands roughly swept aside her fluttering hair, while her soft eyelids hid her killing intent.

Those eyes were now transparent like the glass eyes of a doll and stared coldly at Ryūji.

*She's cute, but she's scary as well.*

She had a pale white face, unbelievably long brunette hair, and tiny limbs and shoulders, while her shiny pupils were surrounded by gentle eyelashes.
She was as adorable as a candy containing deadly toxins, as lovable as a flower that could kill just by scent alone.

And when she stared at him, Ryūji could feel the carnivore leaping out from those eyes of hers.

Of course, this was all just an illusion, yet it felt more real than reality.

The carnivore's weight had knocked Ryūji down on the floor and it roared with a sound that shook deep into his blood.

The sound it produced seemed to be saying, "I can take out a guy like you anytime I want."

The sharp claws and fangs slowly approached him, emanating a sense of bloodthirstiness and the scent of a beast.

Compared to her small figure, the much larger illusion that loomed before him was...a tiger.

"Ah, ahh–ah-ah-ahhh...t–that's right."

Without realizing it, Ryūji began to nod and clapped his hands.

*So that's why she's called the Palmtop Tiger! I wonder who gave her that name, but-*

"-Isn't that a wonderful name?"

*And such a fitting name as well, I'm impressed.*

The girl glanced at Ryūji, silently uttered "dragon", and then looked at him with disdain.

It was not hard to see why.

Whether from the fall or from being ripped open by the phantom tiger, Ryūji's gakuran jacket was now open. Under his jacket, he wore a colorful "Soryū (Rising Dragon)" T-shirt that Yasuko had bought for him. It wasn't like Ryūji had wanted to wear a T-shirt that would cause such misunderstandings, it was just that all his other clothes were in the laundry for that day, and he hadn't been expecting anyone to be able see what he was wearing inside with his jacket on.

Feeling embarrassed for some reason, Ryūji quickly covered his chest, like a girl that just got assaulted by a ruffian. At that moment, he saw someone making her way closer.

"You're late, Taiga! You skipped the Opening Ceremony, didn't you?"

"I overslept. Anyway, I'm glad I'm in the same class as you this year, Minorin."

"Yeah! Me too!"

It was none other than Kushieda Minori.

She called the Palmtop Tiger "Taiga," and even smiled and gently caressed her hair, while the Palmtop Tiger also affectionately called her "Minorin".
While watching all of this, Ryūji began to hear the whispers around him.

"So Round 1 is won by the Palmtop Tiger Aisaka?"

"Looks like Takasu is only scary in appearance, he's no delinquent!"

"Huh? Really?"

"That's why he lost to the Palmtop Tiger. Besides, she's the real thing! She's fierce!"

The misunderstandings were being resolved much sooner than Ryūji had expected, but still...

\*\*\*

The Palmtop Tiger's name was, amazingly enough, Taiga Aisaka. She stood at 145 centimeters tall. Taiga Aisaka and Minori Kushieda were apparently good friends.

According to various whispered conversations Ryūji overheard, it was rumored her father worked as a fixer in the underworld. There was another story that her father was actually a karate master ruling the underworld in America. And then there was yet another that said she herself was a karate expert, but was expelled from her dojo for attacking her master.

Back when she first entered their school, a lot of people were taken by her beauty, and many guys lined up to confess to her. Of course their dreams were all ruthlessly shattered as they were intimidated, bitten, torn to shreds...There were quite a few that never did recover after they were mercilessly belittled by her. Wherever Aisaka went, her path was drenched with the blood of countless corpses of male students.

There was certainly a lot of bad press concerning Taiga Aisaka.

Regardless of whether the rumors were true or not, there was no doubt that she was the most dangerous being in this school. It wasn't until many days after the Opening Ceremony that Ryūji learned about these things.
